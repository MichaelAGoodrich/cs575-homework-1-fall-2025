# CS 236 Final Project Grading Rubric (Total: 100 points)

## 1. Time & Effort (Self-Reported) — 20 points
- **18–20 points**: 15+ hours reported; balanced time between programming and analysis; clearly articulated time breakdown.
- **12–17 points**: 10–14 hours; some imbalance or vague breakdown.
- **6–11 points**: 5–9 hours; limited reflection on time spent.
- **0–5 points**: Less than 5 hours or missing time report.

## 2. Hypothesis Formation & Justification — 20 points
- **16–20 points**: Well-motivated, clearly stated hypotheses related to both network structure and GNN embeddings. Shows creativity and understanding.
- **11–15 points**: Hypotheses are relevant but somewhat vague or under-justified.
- **6–10 points**: Hypotheses present but weak or formulaic; minimal justification.
- **0–5 points**: No clear hypotheses or rationale.

## 3. Application of Network Analysis Methods — 20 points
- **16–20 points**: Effective use of graph operations (e.g., one-mode projection), insightful application of metrics (e.g., modularity, degree centrality), and clear link to hypotheses.
- **11–15 points**: Appropriate use of tools, but connections to hypotheses are underdeveloped.
- **6–10 points**: Superficial or generic metric use; minimal insight gained.
- **0–5 points**: Network metrics barely used or not meaningfully applied.

## 4. Graph Neural Network Design & Evaluation — 20 points
- **16–20 points**: GNN architecture well-justified (layers, features, task); used for meaningful hypothesis evaluation (e.g., clustering analysis or semi-supervised classification).
- **11–15 points**: Reasonable GNN design and usage; some evaluation or interpretation.
- **6–10 points**: GNN used with little justification or connection to hypotheses.
- **0–5 points**: GNN not used or used in a non-substantive way.

## 5. Evaluation & Interpretation of Results — 10 points
- **8–10 points**: Thoughtful reflection on what network/GNN results tell us about Discord messages; comparison across clusters; specific examples cited.
- **5–7 points**: Some interpretation or insights; less specific or thorough.
- **2–4 points**: Minimal evaluation; vague discussion of results.
- **0–1 points**: No real interpretation of findings.

## 6. Clarity & Quality of Writeup — 10 points
- **8–10 points**: Clearly written; well-organized; shows care in presenting methods, results, and insights.
- **5–7 points**: Understandable but may lack polish or depth in explanations.
- **2–4 points**: Hard to follow or poorly organized.
- **0–1 points**: Missing or unreadable writeup.

## Optional Bonus (Up to +5 points)
- Creative use of additional data or models
- Clear reflections on what didn't work and why
- Particularly thoughtful insight into class improvement based on message patterns
