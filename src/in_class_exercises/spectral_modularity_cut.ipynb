The problem to be solved is to partition the vertices of a network in such a way that the modularity metric is maximized. In class, we observed that it is not computationally practical to search through all possible ways of partitioning nodes into two classes (or _shores_ as they were described in class), so we have to find ways to approximate the optimal solution. \n",
