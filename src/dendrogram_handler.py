## Basic code started with sharing the get_all_partitions with chatGPT
## and asking for code to generate the link matrix required for scipy's
## dendrogram function. ChatGPT's code didn't work, but by using the
## understanding_dendrograms Jupyter notebook and iterating with my
## own code and chatGPT's code, this code was produced.

            Use edge betweenness defined by Girvan and Newman to find
            a collection of partitions. 
            
            Each partition is defined as a tuple of groups, and each
            group contains a set of nodes. Partitions require that the 
            set of groups are mutually exclusive and that the union of 
            the groups equals the set of all nodes in the graph.

            Example: A nx.path_graph(5) has nodes {0, 1, ... 4}
            The partitions returned from this function are
            [({0, 1, 2, 3, 4},), (the comma next to "4}" is necessary)
            ({0, 1}, {2, 3, 4}),
            ({0, 1}, {2}, {3, 4}),
            ({0}, {1}, {2}, {3,4}),
            ({0}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {4})]
            The ordering of the partitions in the list is from coarse 
            (fewer sets and low index values) to fine (more sets at high
            index values).

            Limitations: The Girvan-Newman algorithm is slow, so this
            code won't work for large networks.

            Subtleties: The networkx implmentation of the Girvan-Newman
            algorithm doesn't return the original set of nodes, but that
            is required for the merge algorithm (below) to work. This
            code includes the set of all nodes.

        Convert a list of partitions into a linkage matrix. See scipy
        dendrogram and linkage function definitions for the structure of
        the link matrix.
        
        Assumptions:
        • all_partitions is ordered from coarse (few communities) to fine 
            (many communities), with the final partition having each node 
            individually.
        • the difference between partition at index i and index i+1 is
            that one of the groups in partition i has been divided into
            two groups in partition i+1. Thus, each partition only differs
            from the next partition because one set becomes two
        • the first partition (index 0) is the set containing all nodes
        • the last partition (index n-1) is a tuple of sets {0}, {1}, ... {n-1}
        
        The Girvan-Newman method is a divisive process: coars to fine
        We "invert" the divisive process by processing the partitions in reverse order.
        That is, we start from the finest partition (each node alone) and then
        work backward. In each step we determine which two clusters (from the finer level)
        must have merged to form the cluster at the next coarser level.
        
        The linkage matrix represents the nodes in the dendrogram tree. 
        The first and second columns in the linkage matrix which nodes
        will be merged at the node higher up in the tree. 

        Distance (third column of linkage matrix):
        • use the iteration index (plus 1) as the “distance” for the merge,
        • or use size of the cluster as the "distance" for the merge.
        
        Count (fourth column of linkage matrix):
        The fourth column is set to the size of the merged cluster.
        
        Returns:
        • A linkage matrix Z of shape (n-1, 4) where n is the number of nodes.
        • A set of labels for the leaf nodes of the dendrogram tree
